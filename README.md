# IMAGINE

Entire Codebase / project on one file. A design pattern differential build file.

Why so many lines of code? English profressors place essay word limits forcing us to creatively articulate.
Phonetic Words do not translate well to computer code. It clutters our coding approaches. Everything is loopable, tho
our naming systems friction this swift practice.

### (i.e PREVENTION EXAMPLE) Phonetic Language Ease of Code Looping prevention example

    function name () {}
    function age  () {}
    function wave () {}

    name();age();wave();

### (i.e Loop Example) Customized naming system allows Code Looping 

    function a(){}  // name
    function b(){}  // age
    function c(){}  // wave

    funcs[a:c](); //// a();b();c(); === name();age();wave();

# PROPOSED CODEBASE Management 

### The real problem solved

Every industry deals with this, vertical & horizontal scaling/development/maintaining.
The infrastructure/functionality of McDonalds is vertical.
The Physical Establishments of mcDonalds is horizontal.
All vertical changes are best done on the whiteboard, before the horizonts are ever established.
All modifications to the horizonts requires one-by-one fixing where as vertical is one-to-many.

### One Build File ... not monolithic

Super important one person knows whats happening everywhere
- mitigates security problems, 
- prevents unneeded testing, 
- low chance of coding anti-patterns, 
- low chance of premature optimizations, 
- creators avoid bad naming choices.

Differential Design Pattern Build File Explained

0) 1 person codes template / "design patterns", stays at highlevel as subjective mentally possibly. 
1) Then runs a build commands. 
2) Build produces separate file modules.
3) Programmers code assigned modules. 
4) Programmers save assigned modules. 
5) On save builder recentralizes modules, finds new design patterns. Merges design patterns together in for loops and shows "differences". Like differential encoding, except as differential programming. Of course, we don't want something to obscure.

6) Architect/builder tweaks eliminating duplicate synonym naming entropy.
7) Architect reviews tweaks mentoring team, submits tweaks to builder, coffee break.
That surely shrinks a codebase providing great clarity.


### Theory Behind Madness

Effortless reading sleeps the mind.    Normal Printed Code.                 1k lines 100k lines 1M lines
Exhaustive reading drains the mind.    Cryptic Code. Oddly Patterned Code   ??? Lines
Engaged reading feeds the mind.        Build File.                          ??? Lines
